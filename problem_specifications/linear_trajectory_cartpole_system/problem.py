system description: A cartpole system is considered, which consists of a wagon with the mass M,
a rope with the constant length l, which is attached to the wagon, and a load,
which is located at the free end of the rope. The force that can be impressed on the wagon
is available as a manipulated variable.

problem specification for control problem: plan the trajectory of x-position of the load
based on the transfer function.then let the real trajectory of the load converge towards the
target trajectory by using the tracking controller.(x-position of the load from 0m to 1.5m within 5s.)
