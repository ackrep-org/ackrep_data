system description: a two-body floating system is considered. The above iron ball undergoes
a magnetic force generated by a current. A CuZn ball below is attached to that iron ball
by a spring with the spring constant kf.

problem specification for control problem: plan the trajectory of the CuZn ball by using the trajectory
planning based on the transfer function.then let the real trajectory of the ball converge towards the
target trajectory by using the tracking controller.(the ball moves from 0.04m to 0.05m within 5 seconds.)
