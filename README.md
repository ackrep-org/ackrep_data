# Automatic Control Knowledge Repository (ACKRep) Data

This repository holds the data for the ACKRep project. Due to the subject and the concept of
that project, data consists mainly in source code and metadata.

# Basic Concept of ACKRep


The project aims to represent knowledge (in the field of automatic control) in a special way:
as a combination of *problem-specifications* and *problem-solutions*. Both, problems and solutions
can be represented by software modules. To ensure integrity and reproducability,
solution-modules are checked automatically against the respective problems. To facilitate the
operation of this process, some metadata and some other components are also managed in this repo.
Alltogether there are the following entities:

- problem-class
    - e.g. Trajectory Planning for Mechanical Systems
- problem-specification
    - e.g. Swingup control for the Acrobot with specific parameters
- problem-solution
    - e.g. Invocation of an allgorithm which calculates a swingup trajectory for the acrobot
- method
    - e.g. A collection of functions which together implement an algorithm to calculate state space
    transitions for dynamical systems
- docs
    - e.g. A mathematical description of that algorithm e.g. as `.tex`-file
- environment specification
    - A set of rules to setup a software environment such that the above software components
    can be executed
- comments
    - A structured way to add remarks or questions to an entity

**Summary**: In some sense ACKrep translates the concept of continous integration from software
engineering to research in automatic control.


# Data Structure

Every entity consists of a subdirectory with a special structure.

## Metadata
All entities have a file `metadata.yml` which contains both generic data (applicable to all entity types) and type specific
data. Data format is [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (human-readable data-serialization language).

Naming convention: Attributes, files or directories starting with underscore have a special meaning. In most cases they are
autogenerated by software.


### &lt;generic metadata&gt;

- key
    - (identification key; uppercase alphanumeric string of length-5)
- name
    - (string of length <= 40)
- short_description
    - (string of length <= 500)
- version
    - (string like  1.2.3)
- tag_list
    - (list of strings)
- creator
    - (string)
- editor_list
    - (list of strings (email addresses or aliases) )
- creation_date
    - (string of format `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`)
- related_doc_list
    - (list of keys (referring to doc-entities))
- related_dataset_list
    - (list of keys (referring to dataset-entities))
- external_references
    - (list of strings, plain text format (ISO 690), preferably with doi)
- notes
    - (string)

#### `problem.py` example

```python

from scipy.integrate import odeint

from ackrep_core import ResultContainer

class ProblemSpecification(object):
    """
    DoubleIntegratorTransition
    """
    xx_start = (0, 0)
    xx_end = (1, 0)
    T_transition = 1
    constraints = {"x2": [-3, 3], "u1": [-5, 5]}

    @staticmethod
    def rhs(xx, uu):
        return (xx[1], uu[0])


def evaluate_solution(solution_data):

    # assume solution_data.u_func is callable and returns the desired input trajectory

    P = ProblemSpecification

    def rhs(xx, t):
        u_act = solution_data.u_func(t)
        return P.rhs(xx, u_act)

    umin, umax = P.constraints["u1"]
    x2min, x2max = P.constraints["x2"]

    tt = np.linspace(0, P.T_transition, 1000)

    xx_res = odeint(rhs, P.xx_start, tt)

    # boolean result
    success = abs(xx_res[-1, 1] - P.xx_end) < 1e-2

    success &= all(x2min <= xx_res[:, 1]) and all(xx_res[:, 1] <= x2max)

    uu = solution_data.u_func(tt)
    success &= all(umin <= uu) and all(uu <= umax)

    # a simple score heuristic:
    score = np.clip(1 / solution_data.consumed_time, 0, 10)

    return ResultContainer(success=success, score=score)
