notes: 'This solution depends on the file `7L-dae-2020-07-15.pcl` which contains a pickled version of the symbolic model (sympy objects) of the considered 7-Link-system. If this file is not available, the model is created by means of Lagrange equations but this is quite slow and thus not recommended for the server.'
